The well known Pythagorean theorem 
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
 was 
proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:


 x^n + y^n = z^n 
 Standard 
 practice is to write inline math by enclosing it between

In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation 
\(E=mc^2\)
, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.

 Instead if writing (enclosing) inline math between

...
| you can use 
\$

 to achieve the same result:



In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation

 Or, you can use

In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation 
\begin{math}E=mc^2\end{math}
, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.


The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation


E=mc^2

discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 
In natural units (

 = 1), the formula expresses the identity




This is a simple math expression 
\sqrt{x^2+1}
 inside text. 
And this is also the same: 

\sqrt{x^2+1}

but by using another command.

This is a simple math expression without numbering

\sqrt{x^2+1}
 
separated from text.

This is also the same:

\sqrt{x^2+1}
 and this:

\sqrt{x^2+1}
