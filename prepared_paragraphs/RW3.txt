The Law of Sines

In trigonometry, the Law of Sines relates the sides and angles of a triangle. It's given by:




Where 

, 

, and 

 are the sides of the triangle, and 

, 

, and 

 are the opposite angles.


The Mean Value Theorem

The Mean Value Theorem is an essential result in calculus. It states that for a function 

 that is continuous on the closed interval 

 and differentiable on the open interval 

, there exists a point 

 in 

 where the derivative equals the average rate of change:
