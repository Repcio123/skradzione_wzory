#TODO:
#1. function with string comparison
#   - by paragraph
#       * word threshold (eg. 20 in a row)
#       * if eg. 1 in 8 chars are mismatched, it is still considered a match
#   - by sentences (eg. 2 sentences matched means plagarism)
#2. formula comparison
#   - using trees to represent formulas
#   - checking the formula structure - plagarised when formulas are the same with different variable names
#3. different plagarism degrees
#   - overt plagarism (very visible)
#   - possible plagarism (not 100%, but has proof of possibility for plagarism)
#   - vague plagarism (eg. sophisticated words, which happened in other works, every other word matched)
