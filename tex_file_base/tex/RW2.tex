\section{Introduction}
In this article, we will discuss some other mathematical formulas. Let's start with a linear equation:

\begin{equation}
    ax + b = 0
\end{equation}

This equation can be easily solved by computing:

\begin{equation}
    x = -\frac{b}{a}
\end{equation}

\section{The Pythagorean Theorem}
Another example is the famous Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse. We can express this as:

\begin{equation}
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusions}
Mathematics is full of fascinating equations and theorems. Examples such as linear equations and the Pythagorean Theorem help us understand the basics of mathematics and its applications.
