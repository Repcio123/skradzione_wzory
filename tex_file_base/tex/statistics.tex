\section{Introduction}
Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that involves drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It allows us to make predictions, test hypotheses, and generalize findings from a subset to a larger group. In this article, we will explore various concepts in inferential statistics along with the mathematical formulas that underpin these concepts.

\section{Sampling Distributions}

\subsection{Mean and Standard Deviation of a Sample}
For a sample of $n$ observations:
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
\]
\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
\]

\subsection{Central Limit Theorem}
As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution:
\[
\bar{x} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
\]

\section{Confidence Intervals}

\subsection{Confidence Interval for the Mean}
For a confidence level $(1 - \alpha)$:
\[
\bar{x} \pm z \left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\]

\subsection{Confidence Interval for Proportion}
For a confidence level $(1 - \alpha)$:
\[
\hat{p} \pm z \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
\]

\section{Hypothesis Testing}

\subsection{Null and Alternative Hypotheses}
$H_0$: The null hypothesis \\
$H_a$: The alternative hypothesis

\subsection{p-value}
The probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\subsection{Test Statistic for a Population Mean}
\[
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
\]

\section{ANOVA}

\subsection{One-Way ANOVA}
The test statistic for one-way ANOVA:
\[
F = \frac{\text{Between-group variability}}{\text{Within-group variability}}
\]

\section{Conclusion}
Inferential statistics provides valuable tools for making inferences about populations based on sample data. The formulas presented in this article are just a glimpse into the vast world of statistical analysis.
